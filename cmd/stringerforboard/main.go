	//Here we have a 9 byte array created from a byte slice created by converting a string literal
	//Note, I could have done this anonymously using the [9]byte([]byte("XXXOOOXXX")) instead of grid([]byte("XXXOOOXXX"))
	//But the named type grid will come in useful later when I want to write some methods around it.

	fmt.Println("here is....", board)
	// fmt.Println("here it is as string again....", string([]byte(board)))
	// Interestingly, I seem to be able to convert a string to a slice of bytes and then to an array of 9 bytes.
	// But I cannot take an array of 9 bytes and convert it back into a string.
	// There must be a trick to doing this.

	// https: //golangdocs.com/golang-byte-array-to-string

	// Now the Stringer method seems to work fine with an array instead of a slice.
	// It matches the method set of the stringer interface and so can be used with fmt.

	// I could make that String method much more elaborate, for example put it all in a little line grid.
	// However. I will save that until we print out a whole game across the terminal!

	fmt.Printf("%s", board)
